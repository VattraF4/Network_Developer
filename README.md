## Project Statement
In this mini-project, I have designed a simulation of a campus network based on wireless networking, which is divided into three distinct areas: one for the students and the other two for the teachers and academic staff. 

The primary objective of this project is to illustrate the significance of wireless connectivity in university settings, emphasizing mobility as a central focus. To ensure equitable access and functionality for all users, including students, teachers, and various university staff members, we have incorporated DNS, Email, and HTTP servers to maximize resource utilization. Additionally, we have implemented protocols such as BGP and OSPF to enhance network security.

The project is designed based on ***Three-tier hierarchical design architecture***. Each level or tier in the hierarchy is focused on a specific set of roles. This design approach offers network designers a high degree of flexibility to optimize and select the right network hardware, software, and features to perform specific roles for the different network layers.

Consequently, the campus network offers a range of services, including internet connectivity, seamless data sharing among users, and access to various web services for diverse functions. These services rely on wireless networking to facilitate efficient and uninterrupted operations.
